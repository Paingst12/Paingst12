# Mr. Paing Soe Tun - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Paing Soe Tun! 

I have an analytical background and over 9 years of experience in the Telecommunication Service Industry, Network Traffic analytical support, and customer service. I have developed strong expertise in network data analysis, KPI performance evaluation, statistical Data Analysis, and cross-functional coordination to achieve SLA targets.

As an NPO Engineer (Performance Analyst) at ZTE Corporation, I played a key role in customer satisfaction management. I delivered the clean data of the insightful reports to senior management and formulated strategic solutions based on performance insights.

*I was honored by ZTE Myanmar for identifying a site with zero technical issues but low user engagement, thanks to my insightful report and presentation. I successfully optimized this site to increase traffic and maximize its benefits, all without incurring extra costs. As a result, I was recognized as an Outstanding Staff member in March 2021.*

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics (2015), an AGTI in Electronics (2011), and an Advanced Technician Diploma in Electronic Engineering (2016). I also accomplished Data Analysis with Python and Databases & SQL for Data Science with Python by IBM from Coursera.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.



This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### üìå Project: Flight Price Analysis  
**Code:** [`Project: Flight Price Analysis`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** Analyze flight pricing data to identify key factors influencing ticket prices and extract actionable insights. 

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of Flight Price with stops. The dataset included Airline, Source, Destination, Total_Stops, Price, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the Price and Total_Stops, and duration with price.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** offer valuable insights into flight pricing trends, showing how different factors influence airfare.


### üìå E-Commerce Data Analysis in SQL with Python

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** [`Project: E-Commerce Data Analysis in SQL with Python.ipynb`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e2jt-F7WssJGoAQRFHXoHOR_0TG_4-4l?usp=sharing)

**Description:** This project analyzes an E-Commerce dataset sourced from Kaggle to extract valuable insights into **customer behavior, supplier performance, and sales trends** through advanced data visualization techniques. 

## üìÇ Files in This Project
- **`data/`** ‚ûù Contains raw CSV files:
  - `fact_table.csv` ‚Äì Core transaction details
  - `customer_dim.csv` ‚Äì Customer-related information
  - `item_dim.csv` ‚Äì Product specifics
  - `store_dim.csv` ‚Äì Store details
  - `time_dim.csv` ‚Äì Transaction dates
  - `trans_dim.csv` ‚Äì Transaction metadata
  
- **`ECommerce_Analysis.ipynb`** ‚ûù Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis with SQL by Python with pandas.
  
- **`README.txt`** ‚ûù This file provides documentation for the project.
  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, , data visualization.

**Technology:** SQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Data Cleaning and manipulation by Python, and merging 5-Dim tables(customer_dim.csv, item_dim.csv, store_dim.csv, time_dim.csv, Trans_dim.csv) with fact_table.csv on the Foreign_Key and Primary_key by SQL. Depending on data insight, used 'group by', 'join', and categorize 'case' methods, and exported data for visualization.


### üìå Worst-Performance Site analysis (Wk-1 2021)

**Goal:** To analyze the worst-performing sites to take action and the best-performing sites.

**Code:** [`Proven Sample Project: Worst-Performance Site analysis (Wk-1 2021)`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_KxosSlMwRnZZPnZXVoPvU7PkYAnvs-Z?usp=sharing)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sample KPI data related to daily Telecom Site performance. In here, the dataset is not completely actual and was randomly exported from (https://mockaroo.com/). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning, EDA (exploratory data analysis), Power Query Editor, DAX (calculating Down_time_hours, Worst_KPI_sites, and so on).

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** PowerBI, DAX, Power Query Editor.
