Hi, I'm Paing Soe Tun! I have an analytical background and over 9 years of experience in RF engineering (2G, 3G, 4G & 5G), technical support, and customer service. I have developed strong expertise in network data analysis, KPI performance evaluation, statistical Data Analysis, and cross-functional coordination to achieve SLA targets.
As an NPO Engineer at ZTE Corporation, I played a key role in customer satisfaction management. I delivered the clean data of the insightful reports to senior management and formulated strategic solutions based on performance insights.
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics (2015), an AGTI in Electronics (2011), and an Advanced Technician Diploma in Electronic Engineering (2016). I also accomplished Data Analysis with Python and Databases & SQL for Data Science with Python by IBM from Coursera.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
